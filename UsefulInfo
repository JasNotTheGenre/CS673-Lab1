yooo, i can play majong on Ubuntu? it's only the puzzle, not the multiplayer game.

To exit the vim editor do esc and then :x to save without confirmation and :wq to save with confirmation.

Still not confident on what button to press to allow for typing, but spamming asdfgh works!

Do git commit -m "Message" to avoid that weird screen I don't know how to exit.

Simply press q to leave the log page and propbably the weirdd add message page too...
